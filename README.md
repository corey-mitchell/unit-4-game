At the beginning of the game, there will be; a randomly generated number between 25 and 120, four crystals and a user score line. The four crystals each hold a numerical value that the user can only find out by clicking on them, each crystal click adds to the user score line. The objective of the game is for the user to try and match the user score to the randomly generated number using the crystal's unknown numbers. Should the user match the number, it is reset, the wins will go up by one, user score will reset and the crystals each receive a new value. Else if user score exceeds the number then losses go up by one, a new number is generated, user score is reset and the crystals receive new values.
